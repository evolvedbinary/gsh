    <notes>The Kingdoms of Naples and Sicily were led by a shared monarch (or personal union) under
        the House of Bourbon-Two Sicillies from 1759. Conquest by a French army brought down the
        Kingdom, it was briefly replaced by the Parthenopean Republic (a French client) in 1799.
        King Ferdinand recaptured his territories rapidly; however Napoleonâ€™s forces recaptured the
        mainland portion (Kingdom of Naples) of his dual Kingdoms in 1805. Ferdinand fled to Sicily
        in 1806, then under British control. With the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars, Ferdinand
        merged his two Kingdoms into the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies on 18 December 1815.</notes>
