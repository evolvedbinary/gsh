    <notes>Established as the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria in 1900, which was a renaming and
        expansion of the former Niger Coast Protectorate. In 1906 the Lagos Colony and Protectorate
        was incorporated into the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, which was renamed the Colony and
        Protectorate of Southern Nigeria. In 1914, the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria
        merged with the Protectorate of Northern Nigeria, forming the Colony and Protectorate of
        Nigeria.</notes>
