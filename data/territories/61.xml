    <notes>A 1901 constitution created the Republic of Cuba, although the Platt Amendment, which was
        incorporated into the 1901 constitution, placed significant restrictions on Cuban
        sovereignty. According to its terms, Cuba did not have control over its foreign policy; the
        United States was given rights to a naval base on Cuban territory, and U.S. intervention in Cuban
        politics was permitted. Although the U.S. occupation army left Cuba in May 1902, the United States
        occupied Cuba again from 1906 to 1909 and in 1912. The Platt Amendment was abrogated by U.S.
        President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1934.</notes>
