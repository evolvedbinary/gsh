    <notes>First sighted by the Portuguese in the sixteenth-century. Following the Spanish-American
        war, Spain sold the islands to Germany under the terms of the German-Spanish Treaty of 1899.
        Japan took possession of the islands in 1914; the Treaty of Versailles and subsequently the
        League of Nations awarded the islands to Japan. Japan administered the islands as part of
        the South Pacific Mandate. Following World War II, the islands were administered by the
        United States as part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands (agreement signed by
        Truman in 1947). The Truman administration transferred responsibility of the trusteeship to
        the Secretary of Interior in 1951. In 1978, the islands obtained a new constitution; a
        covenant agreement made the constitution fully effective on 4 November 1986.</notes>
