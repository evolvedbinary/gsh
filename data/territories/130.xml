    <notes>Kosovoâ€™s parliament declared independence in 2008. The U.S. Government recognized Kosovo
        and extended diplomatic relations on February 18, 2008. Under the auspices of UN Security
        Council Resolution 1244, the United Nations assumed responsibility for civil and military
        matters in Kosovo in 1999. The role of UNIAMK was reduced as conditions warranted and the
        government of Kosovo assumed essentially all government functions from September 2012
        onward.</notes>
