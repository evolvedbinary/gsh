    <notes>Grenada was incorporated into the British Windward Islands in 1833 and became a British
        colony in 1962. In 1871, Dominica was incorporated into the Federal Colony of the Leeward
        Islands, of which it remained a part until 1940, when it was incorporated into the Federal
        Colony of the Windward Islands. Jamaica became independent in 1962.</notes>
