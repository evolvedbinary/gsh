            <note>Dom Joao returned to Portugal in 1821, leaving his son Dom Pedro in Brazil as
                regent. In 1822, Dom Pedro defied the Portuguese parliament (Cortes) by remaining in
                Brazil. He declared Brazilâ€™s independence in September and was crowned Emperor
                Pedro II on December 1, 1822. The United States recognized the independent Empire
                of Brazil in 1824.</note>
