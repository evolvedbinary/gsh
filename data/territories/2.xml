    <notes>According to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research fact sheet on Dependencies and Areas
        of Special Sovereignty, Akrotiri is a "United Kingdom sovereign base area on the island of
        Cyprus." According to the CIA World Factbook, "By terms of the 1960 Treaty of Establishment
        that created the independent Republic of Cyprus, the UK retained full sovereignty and
        jurisdiction over two areas of almost 254 square kilometers - Akrotiri and Dhekelia. The
        southernmost and smallest of these is the Akrotiri Sovereign Base Area, which is also
        referred to as the Western Sovereign Base Area."</notes>
