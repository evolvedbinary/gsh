    <notes>Pitcairn Island was discovered in 1767 by the British and settled in 1790 by the Bounty
        mutineers and their Tahitian companions. Pitcairn was the first Pacific island to become a
        British colony (in 1838) and today remains the last vestige of that empire in the South
        Pacific.</notes>
