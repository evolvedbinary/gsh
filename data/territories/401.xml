    <notes>Also called Piedmont. While the Kingdomâ€™s mainland possessions were conquered and annexed
        by France during the Napoleonic Wars, the island of Sardinia remained independent ensuring
        continuity of government. Probably the most direct and important ancestor of the Kingdom of
        Italy, under the leadership of Count Camillo Cavour. Was the primary belligerent in alliance
        with France against Austria in the three Italian Wars of Independence, fought over
        Lombardy-Venetia. Nice and Savoy were transferred to the French in March 1860 in exchange
        for support in creating a united Italy. Shortly after this transfer was completed, Sardinia
        absorbed the United Provinces of Central Italy. This merged entity became the Kingdom of
        Italy in a merger with the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies in March 1861.</notes>
