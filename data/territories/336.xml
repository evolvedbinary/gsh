    <notes>Though sighted by the Portuguese as early as the sixteenth century, the Ellice Islands
        were named for the owner of the ship whose captain visited the Funafuti Atoll in 1819. From
        1892 to 1916, the Ellice Islands were part of the Gilbert Islands Protectorate; from 1916 to
        1975, Tuvalu was the ‘Ellice’ in the Gilbert and Ellice Islands, a crown colony.</notes>
