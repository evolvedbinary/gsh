            <note>Iran has often been referred to as Persia since ancient Greek times, the name
                deriving from Greek records and histories. In 1935, the Shah requested that foreign
                nations refer to the nation and its citizens as Iran and Iranians, the Persian
                (Farsi) language terms. Since that time, Iran/Iranians have generally been accepted
                as the correct nomenclature for the modern nation while Persia/Persian are used to
                refer to the empires and cultures of antiquity.</note>

    <notes>In December 1925, the Iranian Constituent Assembly deposed the last member of the Qajar
        Dynasty and installed the first member of the Pahlavi Dynasty as monarch. Some sources give
        October 24, 1979, as the founding date of the Islamic Republic of Iranâ€“the date a referendum
        adopting the new constitution was held. However since the interim government held office
        following this date and the constitution did not take effect until December 3, the later
        date appears more correct.</notes>
