    <notes>Cuba was a colony of Spain from the 16th century, technically part of the Viceroyalty of
        New Spain, but governed after the 1760s by the Captaincy General of Cuba based in Havana.
        Cuban revolutionaries declared independence in 1868 and again in 1895, fighting long wars
        against Spain both times. In 1898, Spain ceded control of Cuba to the United States after a
        brief war. The United States occupied Cuba until 1902.</notes>
