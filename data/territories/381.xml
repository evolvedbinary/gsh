    <notes>The Grand Duchy of Tuscany was transformed in the Kingdom of Etruria by the Treaty of
        Aranjuez in 1801. This Kingdom was a client state of Napoleonic France. Etruria was directly
        annexed into the French Empire in 1807. Napoleonâ€™s defeat resulted in a restoration of the
        Grand Duchy in 1815. The deposition of the ruling House of Hapsburg-Lorraine and a
        referendum resulted in Tuscany joining the United Provinces of Central Italy, a client state
        of the Kingdom of Sardinia intended as a transitional means of creating a unified Italian
        state.</notes>
