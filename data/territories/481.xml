    <notes>The kingdom of Rwanda/Ruanda emerged in the 16th century as a small nuclear kingdom,
        ruled by the Tutsi minority, that persisted until the arrival of Europeans in the 19th
        century. The kingdom grew over time, and for portions of its history after 1776, the kingdom
        was challenged by the growth of other sovereignties within present-day Rwanda, such as a
        series of independent Tutsi states that emerged around 1850 (of which the kingdom of Gisaka
        in the east was the most powerful). A royal succession crisis in 1895 led to civil war and
        weakened the kingdom in the face of European colonial expansion. German explorers first
        entered Rwanda in 1894, but did not effectively take control of the territory until 1898,
        formally annexing it to German East Africa in 1899. The kingdom of Rwanda and its royal
        lines continued under colonial occupation, but were no longer sovereign.</notes>
