    <notes>From 1538 to 1717, the colony was known as the New Kingdom of Granada, a subunit of the
        Viceroyalty of Peru after the latterâ€™s creation in 1544. In 1717, the Viceroyalty of the New
        Kingdom of Granada was established, comprised of Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, and Venezuela.
        It was succeeded in 1723 by the Presidency of the New Kingdom of Granada. Finally, in 1739,
        the Viceroyalty of the New Kingdom of Granada was reestablished.</notes>
