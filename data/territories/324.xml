    <notes>In 1763, Great Britain gained sovereignty over Dominica, formerly a French colony, as a
        result of the Treaty of Paris. The following year, Dominica was merged with several other
        British colonies into a single colonial unit, the Southern Caribbee Islands. In 1771,
        Dominica was designated a discrete British colony. In 1778, during the American
        Revolutionary War, France regained control over Dominica, but returned the island to Great
        Britain at the end of the war in 1783. In 1871, Dominica was incorporated into the Federal
        Colony of the Leeward Islands, of which it remained a part until 1940, when it was
        incorporated into the Federal Colony of the Windward Islands. ‚óè In 1958, Dominica joined the
        Federation of the West Indies, a group of British Caribbean colonies granted domestic
        self-government as a step along the path to independence. When the Federation dissolved in
        1962, Dominica did not become independent, instead becoming a discrete British colony. In
        1967, Dominica gained sovereignty over its domestic affairs as an Associated State.</notes>
