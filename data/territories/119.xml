    <notes>The United States recognized independence in 1854. Though the Japanese refer to their
        country as Nippon, the name Japan seems to be relevant to many cultures across time periods.
        In 1603, the Tokugawa governance structure took form under the Emperor, marking the last
        government of Japan prior to its opening to the West in 1853. From 1945 until 1952,
        following WWII, Japan was under Allied military occupation, which was largely overseen by
        the United States.</notes>
