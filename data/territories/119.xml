    <notes>U.S. recognized independence in 1854. Though the Japanese refer to their country as
        Nippon, the name Japan seems to be relevant to many cultures across time periods. The
        date included here is the date of the Tokugawa governance structure taking form under the
        Emperor, marking the last government of Japan prior to its opening to the West in 1853. </notes>
