    <notes>The Principality of Monaco was annexed to the French Republic in 1793. After Napoleon's
        defeat in 1814, the Principality of Monaco became the designated protectorate of the Kingdom
        of Sardinia until 1860. From 1860 until 1861, it was the designated protectorate of the
        Second French Empire before declaring independence in 1861. </notes>
