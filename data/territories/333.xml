    <notes>According to The Oxford Companion to Politics of the World: “After
        the 1974 armed forces coup in Portugal, the small mestizo elite split over the options of
        independence or continued association with Portugal. In a brief civil war in August 1975,
        the left-wing pro-independence Frente Revolucionaria do Timor Leste Independente (Fretilin)
        defeated the conservative associationist forces. Fearing Fretilin's left-wing connections,
        Indonesia invaded the territory in September. Fretilin declared independence on 28 November,
        but was forced from the capital, Dili, after an Indonesian airborne attack in December 1975.
        The UN General Assembly called on Indonesia to withdraw and the Security Council condemned
        the invasion, but many observers believe that the invasion initially had the tacit approval
        of the United States and Australia. Indonesia formally annexed the territory on 15 July
        1976.”</notes>
