    <notes>Liechtenstein was originally created for and named after an Austrian noble for services
        to the Holy Roman Empire. Lichtenstein was thus until 1806 and the end of the Holy Roman
        Empire most properly thought of as a province or fief within the larger polity. The
        decentralized and localized nature of power and sovereignty within the Holy Roman Empire
        compared to a modern state suggests however that Liechtensteinâ€™s status during this period
        can be thought of as more properly national than might be the case for a subsidiary
        jurisdiction in a modern state.</notes>
