    <notes>An Edo Kingdom dating from well before 1500. Associated with present-day Benin City,
        Nigeria; not to be confused with the neighboring nation of Benin. The Kingdom of Benin was
        already a well-established agricultural community when it became a dependency of the Yoruba
        capital of Ife at the beginning of the 14th century. Already by the 15th century, however,
        Benin was independent, ruled by a king who according to tradition was descended from the Ife
        dynasty. By the late 15th century, Benin was in contact with Portugal; by the time of its
        apogee as a trading and political power in the 16th and 17th centuries, Benin encompassed
        parts of southeastern Yorubaland and the small Igbo area on the western bank of the Niger
        River. By around 1700, it added coastal Lagos as a colony/dependency, which it held until
        the British annexed Lagos Colony in 1861. In 1897, following allegations of human sacrifice
        being practiced in Benin, the British forcefully incorporated the Kingdom of Benin into the
        Niger Coast Protectorate.</notes>
