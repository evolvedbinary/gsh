    <notes>Granted to Austria at the Congress of Vienna, composed of the former Duchy of Milan and
        Republic of Venice. An 1848 uprising against Austrian rule in Milan led to the formation of
        the Provisional Government of Milan which was quickly suppressed by Imperial forces. The
        First Italian War of Independence resulted in the creation of a Republic of San Marco in
        Venetian territory which attempted to join Sardinia prior to the victory of Austrian forces
        and the restoration of the status quo in 1849. The Second Italian War of Independence
        largely contested over the fate of this Kingdom, resulted in the Treaty of Zurich (10
        November 1859), which transferred Lombardy briefly to the French Empire, which then passed
        it to the Kingdom of Sardinia. A similar outcome resulted from the Third Italian War of
        Independence (1866); the Treaty of Vienna, signed October 12, 1866, transferred Venetia
        briefly to the French Empire which immediately passed it on to the Kingdom of Italy.</notes>
