    <notes>The Irish Parliament declared Henry VIII and his descendants monarchs of Ireland in 1542,
        creating a union of the crowns. Ireland was a subsidiary client state to the Kingdoms of
        England, the Commonwealth, and the Kingdom of Great Britain during this period. Ireland was
        fully integrated into the United Kingdom in the Acts of Union 1800 which dissolved the Irish
        Parliament and consolidated political and administrative functions in London and went into
        effect in 1801.</notes>
