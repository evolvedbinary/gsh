    <notes>In 1764, the French established a naval base at Port Louis (East Falkland I./Isla Soledad);
        Islands named Ǐles Malouines by French mariner Louis-Antoine de Bougainville. The British
        claim to the Islands was established in 1765 by Royal Navy captain John Byron, who named the
        territory Falkland’s Islands. In 1770, Spain acquired the French claims to the islands. When
        Argentina declared its independence from Spain in 1816, it claimed the Falkland Islands as a
        successor to the Spanish claim. By 1833, British sovereign claim to the Islands was
        restablished with a new settlement and administration.</notes>
