    <notes>While England claimed Barbados as a colony in 1625, it was not permanently settled until
        1627. In 1833, the British colony of the Windward Islands was created by merging the
        colonies of Barbados, Grenada, St. Vincent, and Tobago; five years later, St. Lucia was
        added. In 1885, Barbados was again designated a discrete British colony. In 1958, Barbados
        joined the Federation of the West Indies, a group of British Caribbean colonies granted
        domestic self-government as a step along the path to independence. When the Federation
        dissolved in 1962, Barbados did not become independent, instead retaining its status as a
        discrete British colony with sovereignty over its domestic affairs.</notes>
