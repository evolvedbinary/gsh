    <notes>From the 18th century, the Cayman Islands was regarded as a dependency of the British
        colony of Jamaica, a relationship that was formalized with their merger in 1863. In 1958,
        Jamaica joined the Federation of the West Indies, a group of British Caribbean colonies
        granted domestic self-government as a step along the path to independence. In 1962, the
        Cayman Islands became a discrete British colony when Jamaica became independent and the
        Federation of the West Indies was dissolved. As a result of the adoption of its constitution
        in 1972, and subsequent revisions in 1994 and 2009, the Cayman Islands gained sovereignty
        over its domestic affairs.</notes>
