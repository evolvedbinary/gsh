    <notes>From 1806 to 1815 Liechtenstein was unquestionably sovereign. The Embassy of the
        Lichtenstein in the United States gives 1806 as the official date of independence. In 1815,
        it became part of the German Confederation, a loose association of German speaking nations
        brought together following the conclusion of the Congress of Vienna. Akin to the Holy Roman
        Empire the German Confederation was a fissiparous and imprecise assemblage within which
        individual members retained significant sovereignty. The Confederation collapsed in 1866 at
        which point Lichtenstein became once more indisputably fully sovereign. Following World War
        I, Liechtenstein entered a customs and monetary union with Switzerland as traditional ties
        with Austria were of less use due to the unfavorable outcome of the conflict.</notes>
