    <notes>The precise names and tenures of these pre-colonial states are sometimes difficult to
        discern from the sources consulted, but in general, they correspond to the three major
        ethnic groups of pre-colonial (and present-day) Namibia: The Nama, Herero, and Ovambo (or
        Ambo). Hereroland was a term used by Europeans in the 19th century to refer to the central
        part of present-day Namibia under the political control of the Hereros. Herero leaders
        signed a protectorate agreement with Germany in 1885 but renounced it in 1888; a treaty was
        reestablished in 1889 or 1890, at which point Germany felt that it had established all the
        necessary agreements with Namibian and European powers in order to “annex” all of present-
        day Namibia, with the backing of German military forces. Hereros, however, continued to
        fight the German military in the 1890’s, and again from 1903 to 1907, when German forces
        engaged in a war of extermination with the Herero and killed approximately 80% of the total
        Herero population.</notes>
