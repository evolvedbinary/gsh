    <notes>In 1932, French Indochina annexed the islands and set up a weather station on Pattle
        Island; maintenance was continued by its successor, Vietnam. China has occupied all the
        Paracel Islands since 1974, when its troops seized a South Vietnamese garrison occupying the
        western islands. China built a military installation on Woody Island with an airfield and
        artificial harbor. The islands also are claimed by Taiwan and Vietnam.</notes>
