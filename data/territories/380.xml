    <notes>In the Treaty of Nanking (August 1842), Hong Kong island was ceded “in perpetuity” to
        Britain. In the Treaty of Peking (1860), Kowloon (the tip of the peninsula directly opposite
        Hong Kong island on the mainland) was ceded as well. In 1898, Britain extended the territory
        under its control by leasing the New Territories (a larger portion of land surrounding
        Kowloon, as well as Lantau Island and other nearby small islands) for 99 years. The
        Sino-British Joint Declaration (December 1984) clarified that all of Hong Kong would be
        handed over to the People’s Republic of China in July 1997.</notes>
