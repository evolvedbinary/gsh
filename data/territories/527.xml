    <notes>At first a buffer zone between Asante and Dahomey and occupied on the coast by the Danes,
        it became a German colony after German missionaries and traders were able to gain support
        from local leaders and formally submit a claim to Togoland. During World War I, Togoland was
        invaded by Allied forces, and the German colony was split into two administrative districts.
        The western regeion of the colony was administered by the United Kingdom, the eastern by
        France. Although the partition was agreed upon in 1916, it was not formalized until 1922 by
        the League of Nations.</notes>
