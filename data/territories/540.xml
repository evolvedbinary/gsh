    <notes>An early 15th century Peul kingdom established in the floodplains of the Niger River
        within the area of Dia in present-day Mali. An overthrow of the ruling dynasty of the “Peul
        Kingdom of Macina” in 1810 led to the establishment of the “Peul Empire of Macina.” Prior to
        1810, Macina appears to have been intermittently independent and subject to other kingdoms
        and empires, including as a vassal state to the Mali Empire in the 15th century, and also as
        a dependency of Moroccan and Songhay entities and even the Ségou Kingdom (after 1670). After
        the establishment of the Peul Empire of Macina in 1810, Macina remained independent until
        its demise. In 1862, shortly after conquering Ségou, El Hadj Omar Tall conquered Macina as
        well and incorporated it into his Tukulor Empire.</notes>
