    <notes>The Duchy was captured by the French in 1796, after which it was disestablished and
        formed part of a number of French client states until 1814. Some 45 years after the
        restoration, Duke Francis V fled during the Second Italian War of Independence.
        Subsequently, the Duchy jointed the United Provinces of Central Italy, a client state of
        Sardinia and a prelude to a unified Italian Kingdom.</notes>
