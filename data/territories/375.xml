    <notes>Invaded by Napoleonâ€™s armies in 1796, the Bishopric was mediatized into the Austrian
        county of Tyrol in 1803. It definitively ceased to exist upon the dissolution of the Holy
        Roman Empire in 1806. The former Bishopric was incorporated into the Austrian Empire as the
        County of Tyrol in 1803 (de facto) and 1806 (de jure). The 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain
        split the territory between the State of Tyrol (granted to the Republic of German Austria)
        and South Tyrol and Trentino, granted to the Kingdom of Italy. Austria controlled the
        Kingdom of Naples, the Republic of Venice, and the Kingdom of Lombardy-Venetia for
        significant portion (or in the case of the latter entire) existence. They were not formally
        incorporated as provinces of the Empire in the manner of the former Bishopric
        however.</notes>
