    <notes>Grenada was ceded to Britain in 1763 by the Treaty of Paris, which ended the Seven Years
        War. In 1779, the French recaptured the island and held it, until losing it back to the
        British in 1783. Grenada was formally incorporated into the British Windward Islands from
        1833 to 1962, and Grenada was part of the West Indies Federation (a parallel structure) from
        1958 to 1962. It became a colony of Britain after the West Indies Federation's dissolution
        in 1962 and achieved independence in 1974.</notes>
