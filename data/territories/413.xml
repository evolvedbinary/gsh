    <notes>The Imperial Free City was a Habsburg possession. A major port city primarily populated
        by Italians and Slovenes, it enjoyed an unusual degree of freedom and autonomy within the
        Empire. Occupied by French troops during the Napoleonic wars, the territory was annexed into
        the Illyrian Provinces, a French client, under the terms of the October 1809 Treaty of
        Schönbrunn. The Congress of Vienna restored the territory to Austria as the Kingdom of
        Illyria. The territory of this new creation was more expansive than the Free City’s marches,
        including significant portions of modern day Austria, Croatia, and Slovenia. The disruptions
        occasioned by the 1848 Revolutions led the Austrians to spilt the Kingdom into provinces and
        restore Trieste’s free city status. The Kingdom of Italy officially gained control of
        Trieste with the November 1920 Treaty of Rapallo, though the area had been occupied by
        Italian forces for some time prior. Trieste retained a degree of autonomy until the rise of
        the Fascist movement in 1922 led to the abolition of local autonomy.</notes>
