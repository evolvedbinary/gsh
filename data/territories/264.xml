    <notes>Singapore was established in 1299. In 1511, the Johor Sultanate took control of Singapore
        until 1818. In 1819, Singapore was claimed by the British East India Company. In 1824, Great
        Britain recognized Singapore as a Crown Colony. In 1958, Great Britain elevated the status
        of Singapore to that of state. Singapore joined the Federation of Malaysia in 1963. </notes>
