    <notes>A long process of negotiating Belizean independence from the United Kingdom while also
        ensuring its independence from the claims of neighboring Guatemala began in the 1960s. In
        1973, the colonyâ€™s name was changed to Belize and it became self-governing. In 1981, the
        United Kingdom recognized Belizean independence and it became a member of the
        Commonwealth.</notes>
