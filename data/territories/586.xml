    <notes>Fishery and imperial possession from 1713-1825. Colony from 1825-1907. From 1907 to 1949,
        Newfoundland was a self-governing dominion that technically enjoyed the same status as
        Canada within the British Empire/Commonwealth. However, Newfoundland did not govern itself
        from 1934 to 1949, but rather was governed by the Commission of Government, as financial
        troubles stemming from the Great Depression led to its reversion to quasi-colonial status.
        Joined Canada in 1949.</notes>
