    <notes>From 1713 to 1825, Newfoundland was an imperial possession. In 1825, it was designated a colony. From 1907 to 1949,
        Newfoundland was a self-governing dominion; however, from 1934 to 1949, Newfoundland
        was governed by the Commission of Government, as a result of financial
        troubles stemming from the Great Depression.
        In 1949, Newfoundland joined Canada.</notes>
