    <notes>According to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research fact sheet on Dependencies and Areas
        of Special Sovereignty, "Antarctica consists of the territory south of 60 degrees south
        latitude. This area includes claims by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand,
        Norway, and the United Kingdom, the legal status of which remains in suspense under the
        terms of the Antarctic Treaty of 1959. The United States recognizes no claims to
        Antarctica." The Antarctic Treaty entered into force in 1961, and Antarctica is
        administered through consultative member nations.</notes>
