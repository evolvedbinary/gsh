    <notes>Initially established as the Tukulor Empire around 1852 by El Hadj Omar Tall. Tall
        gradually defeated and subsumed the Kingdoms of Kaarta, Macina, and Ségou. With the defeat
        of Ségou in 1862, the Tukulor Empire also became known as the Ségou-Tukulor Empire, which is
        consistent with the developments following Tall’s death in 1864: his son Amadou Tall
        succeeded him in Ségou, continuing the Tukulor Empire there. However, Amadou Tall was never
        able to control Macina or Kaarta, which were ruled by his brothers and other relatives who
        never fully recognized his supremacy. The Ségou-Tukulor Empire ultimately collapsed after
        being gradually defeated by the French by 1893.</notes>
