    <notes>Prior to France’s military colonization of the area that is present-day Niger, portions
        of the region were occupied and governed by a number of different groups, kingdoms, states,
        and empires. However, with the exception of Damagaram, jurisdictions, tenures, and
        relationships to one another are not clear enough from the sources consulted to include as
        predecessor states or territories. In the period between roughly the late 18th century and
        late 19th century, Niger’s precolonial entities included: the Bornu Empire (Kanuri peoples),
        several Hausa states/dynasties (including the Gobir monarchy, the sultanate of Damagaram,
        and Hausa states at times under the control of the Sokoto Empire/Caliphate), Songhay-Zarma
        peoples, Fulani groups (centered in what is now Degel, Nigeria; and later in Say, Niger),
        and the nomadic Tuareg. A number of these groups continued to lay claims and exert control
        over portions of present-day Niger for some time after French entry.</notes>
