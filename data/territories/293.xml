    <notes>Spain claimed that Mayan inhabitants of present-day Belize were ruled by the Viceroyalty
        of New Spain, but British settlers and sailors in the area prevented the viceroy from
        exercising full sovereignty. Formal British government was not organized over the area until
        the late 18th century; the British began sending superintendents in 1786 and British
        settlers drove off the last Spanish attack in 1796. A Legislative Assembly was established
        in 1854. The British colony of British Honduras was formally established in 1862, and it
        became a crown colony in 1871.</notes>
