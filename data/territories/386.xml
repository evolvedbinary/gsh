    <notes>Parma was occupied by French troops in 1796. Duke Ferdinand died in December 1802 at
        which point the Duchy passed into French administration. It was formally annexed into the
        French Empire in 1808. Independence was restored by the Congress of Vienna in 1814. Parma
        was merged into other states in 1859 as the United Provinces of Central Italy, a client
        government of Sardinia intended as an intermediate step toward Italian unification.</notes>
