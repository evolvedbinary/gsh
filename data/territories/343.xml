    <notes>The Federation of Mali was established on January 10, 1959, with Senegal and the Sudanese
        Republic as members. Upper Volta and Dahomey also briefly joined, but withdrew by April
        1959. None of these constituent members were yet fully independent from France, though
        several were “autonomous states within the French Community.” On June 20, 1960, the
        Federation of Mali became fully independent;</notes>
