    <notes>Germany controlled German New Guinea from 1884 until 1921, at which point Australia took
        control over the territory. Great Britain controlled British New Guinea from 1884 until
        1905; from 1906 until 1945, Australia controlled the territory, renaming it Territory of
        Papua. The two territories were combined under Australian control as the Territory of Papua
        New Guinea from 1945 until 1949. Note: The sources cited here disagree on some of these
        dates.</notes>
