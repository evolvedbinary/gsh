    <notes>The Dominican Republic celebrates February 27, 1844, the date that it essentially
        overthrew Haitian rule, as its independence day. From 1861 until 1865, it was a Spanish
        colony. During the first quarter of the 20th century, the United States increasingly exerted
        control over the Dominican Republic, establishing first a customs receivership in 1905,
        followed by a military government in 1916 that endured until 1924. From 1965 to 1966, the
        United States, along with the Organization of American States, again militarily intervened
        in the Dominican Republic.</notes>
