    <notes>The Duchy was invaded by Napoleon’s forces in 1796, after which it was appended to a
        series of French client states until restoration subsequent to final French defeat.
        Following the death of Maria Beatrice d’Este, Duchess of Massa, her son Francis IV, Duke of
        Modena annexed the Duchy of Massa and Carrera, adding it to the larger territory he had come
        to possess in the aftermath of the Napoleonic Wars.</notes>
