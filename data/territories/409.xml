    <notes>Following the abdication of the Czar, Latvia remained within the provisional Russian
        Republic until it was deposed in the October Revolution. During this gap period, Latvia was
        contested between warring parties in the Russian Civil War and was partly controlled in the
        form of client states by the German Empire (Duchy of Courland and Semigallia and United
        Baltic Duchy) after the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk, in which the Bolshevik government ceded
        control of the Baltic region to Germany. Neither of these clients were recognized by any
        government other than the German Empire. Latvia declared independence on November 18, 1918,
        and was mired in a war of independence with the Soviets until the signing of the
        Latvian-Soviet Peace Treaty on 11 August 1920. Latvia was admitted into the League of
        Nations in 1921 and was recognized by the U.S. Government on July 28, 1922. The Red Army
        occupied Latvia in June 1940. A pliable government was installed which petitioned for
        admission to the Soviet Union; ascension was granted on August 5. Latvia was occupied by
        Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1944.</notes>
