    <notes>In 1914, the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria merged with the Protectorate of
        Northern Nigeria, forming the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. Shortly thereafter, with
        the outbreak of World War I, Nigerian (British) forces attacked neighboring German Kamerun,
        capturing it in 1916. The British portion of this territory (France also administered a
        portion) became British Cameroons and was administered by the British as part of Nigeria.
        However, since it was legally a separate territory, designated as a League of Nations
        mandate and later a United Nations Trust Territory under its own name, it is not treated
        here as a predecessor to the Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria. However, the portion of
        British Cameroons that later voted to become part of independent Nigeria is included as a
        predecessor to Nigeria. On October 1, 1960, Nigeria became an independent country in the
        British Commonwealth.</notes>
