    <notes>Lagos was established around 1700 as a colony of the Kingdom of Benin, a precolonial
        kingdom in present-day Nigeria. During that time, however, Lagos continued to have its own
        dynastic leadership which was increasingly characterized by internal power struggles linked
        to the slave trade in the 19th century. This instability led in part to Britainâ€™s
        intervention in the colony of Lagos in 1861.</notes>
