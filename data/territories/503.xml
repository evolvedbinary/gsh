    <notes>The precise names and tenures of these pre-colonial states are sometimes difficult to
        discern from the sources consulted, but in general, they correspond to the three major
        ethnic groups of pre-colonial (and present-day) Namibia: The Nama, Herero, and Ovambo (or
        Ambo). Ovamboland was a term used by Europeans in the 19th century to refer to the northern
        part of present-day Namibia under the political control of the Ovambo/Ambo (a conglomeration
        of eight Bantu-speaking societies/chieftanships). Ovamboland remained under the practical
        control of Ovambo leadership longer than Hereroland or the Red Nation. Germany did not
        solidify its claims to Ovamboland until 1890, and Ovamboland retained its practical
        sovereignty throughout much of the existence of German South West Africa and even the early
        years of South West Africa. Ovamboland’s Kwanyama King/Chief Mandume actively fought to
        maintain Ovamboland’s independence from 1914 until his death at the hands of South African
        troops in 1917.</notes>
