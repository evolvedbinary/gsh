    <notes>The Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia united to form Romania, under Ottoman rule,
        in 1862. After the Ottomans were defeated in the Russo-Turkish War, Prince Charles declared
        Romanian independence. The United States recognized independence in 1881. At the end of
        World War I, Greater Romania came into being through the acquisition of Transylvania and the
        Banat from Hungary, Bukovina from Austria, and Bessarabia from Russia. As a result, the
        country's territory doubled. In 1940, Moldova was incorporated into the Soviet
        Union.</notes>
