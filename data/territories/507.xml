    <notes>In 1843, the United Kingdom established the Falkland Island Dependencies, which included
        South Georgia Island. The Dependencies was extended with the inclusion of the South Sandwich
        Islands, South Shetland Islands, South Orkney Islands, and Graham Land in 1908. In 1962, it
        was reduced to South Georgia and South Sandwich Islands following the establishment of
        British Anarctic Territory.</notes>
