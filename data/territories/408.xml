    <notes>Genoa was transformed into the Ligurian Republic, a client state of Napoleonic France in
        1797. In June 1805, the region was annexed into metropolitan France. The defeat of Napoleon
        allowed the Republic to briefly regain its independence in 1814. The Congress of Vienna
        awarded the Republic to the Kingdom of Sardinia as a buffer against France in early
        1815.</notes>
