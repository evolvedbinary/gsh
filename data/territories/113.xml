    <notes>An Irish Republic was declared by revolutionaries in 1919. Although it came to control
        much of the island of Ireland by 1922 it was never formally recognized by the United
        Kingdom. The Anglo-Irish Treaty created the Irish Free State in December 1922, an
        independent nation with commonwealth status. The United States recognized the Irish Free
        State in 1924. A new constitution which changed the name of the nation from ‘Irish Free
        State’ to ‘Ireland’ (‘Éire’ in Gaelic) took effect on December 29, 1937. In 1949, through
        the Republic of Ireland Act, Ireland severed its ties to the commonwealth and the British
        monarchy and declared that the state ‘shall be described as the Republic of Ireland.’ This
        distinction may have been adopted in part because the government of the United Kingdom
        objected to referring to the nation in question as ‘Ireland’ given the distinction between
        the island and the polities situated upon it.</notes>
