    <notes>Special administrative region of China. Has had varying degrees of autonomy, but has
        generally been a dependent territory of China and its predecessors, with a period beginning
        in 1887 when its ownership was contested between China and Portugal. It was returned to
        China in 1999 as a special administrative region with some autonomous functions.</notes>
