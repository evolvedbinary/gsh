    <notes>Became independent on October 1, 1960, as a member of the British Commonwealth.
        Officially became a republic on October 1, 1963. The northern portions of the UN Trust
        Territory of the British Cameroons joined Nigeria in June 1961 following a plebiscite in the
        British Cameroons. The “Republic of Biafra” declared its independence from Nigeria in 1967
        and attempted to secede, but was defeated after three years of civil war. </notes>
