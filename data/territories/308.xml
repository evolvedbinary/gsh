    <notes>Beginning in the 11th century, the Hausa developed centralized states in the northern
        portion of present-day Nigeria. These included Daura, Katsina, Kano, Zaria, Gobir, and,
        later, Kebbi. Each had a walled city, a market center, and a monarchical system of
        government. At times independent, the Hausa states were at different times and in different
        places brought under the control of the Songhai / Songhay Empire as well as the Bornu Empire
        to the east. Fulani Muslim scholar (mallam) Usman dan Fodio initiated a revolutionary jihad
        in the Hausa state of Gobir in 1804, leading by 1808 to an overthrow of most of the Hausa
        states in Hausaland (northern Nigeria), some of which had formerly been under the Empire of
        Bornu to the east. This brought the former Hausa states into the Fulani Empire by 1808,
        though it appears that some (in present-day northeastern Nigeria) may have remained under
        Bornu.</notes>
