    <notes>Lagos was established around 1700 as a colony of the Kingdom of Benin, a precolonial
        kingdom in present-day Nigeria. During that time, however, Lagos continued to have its own
        dynastic leadership which was increasingly characterized by internal power struggles linked
        to the slave trade in the 19th century. This instability led in part to Britain’s
        intervention in the colony of Lagos in 1861. The British annexed Lagos Colony in 1861,
        placing it under the colonial administration of Freetown in Sierra Leone. Britain gradually
        increased its zone of control from Lagos into adjoining coastal areas after 1861. In 1886,
        Lagos Colony expanded and was renamed the “Lagos Colony and Protectorate,” and also came
        under its own colonial administration. In 1906 the Lagos Colony and Protectorate was
        incorporated into the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, which was renamed the Colony and
        Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.</notes>
