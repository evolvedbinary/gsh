    <notes>The British annexed Lagos Colony in 1861, placing it under the colonial administration of
        Freetown in Sierra Leone. Britain gradually increased its zone of control from Lagos into
        adjoining coastal areas after 1861. In 1886, Lagos Colony expanded and was renamed the
        “Lagos Colony and Protectorate,” and also came under its own colonial administration. In
        1906 the Lagos Colony and Protectorate was incorporated into the Protectorate of Southern
        Nigeria, which was renamed the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria.</notes>
