    <notes>Established as the Civil Territory of Mauritania in 1904.  Some sources indicate a French
        protectorate was declared over portions or all of the same area in 1902 or perhaps even
        1901.  Although established as its own territory and in its own name in 1904 (and included
        in its own name as a constituent part of French West Africa in 1920), it appears Mauritania
        remained administratively linked to the French colony of Senegal until 1946.  Mauritania
        formally became a constituent part of French West Africa (Afrique Occidentale Française) on
        December 4, 1920.  It became a French Overseas Territory in 1946, which afforded greater
        forms of self-governance; it was also administratively separated from Senegal in the same
        year.  Mauritania became independent from France on November 28, 1960.</notes>
