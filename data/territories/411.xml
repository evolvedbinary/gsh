    <notes>Libya officially became an Italian colony when the Ottoman Empire ceded it to Italy in
        1912 under the Treaty of Ouchy. However, Italy was in a constant struggle for control over
        the region until 1934. The territories of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania, and Fezzan were unified
        by Italy as Libya in 1934. Although Italian control over Libya officially lasted until 1947,
        from 1943 until 1947 Britain and France jointly managed the region. From 1947 until 1951,
        Tripolitania and Cyrenaica were under British administration, while Fezzan was under French
        control.</notes>
