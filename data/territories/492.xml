    <notes>Colony of Portugal.  Possibly known as “Sao Tome and Principe” between its discovery by
        Portugal (1470) and its establishment as a Portuguese colony, but record is not clear.  The
        colony was established in 1493.  Uninhabited prior to Portuguese discovery.  In 1778 the
        islands of Fernando Pó (Bioko) and Annobón (Pagalu) were ceded from the Portuguese colony to
        Spain (the islands are now part of Equatorial Guinea.)  Became independent on July 12,
        1975.</notes>
