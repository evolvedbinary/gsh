    <notes>Occupied by the French from February 1799 and incorporated into a number of French client
        states until 1815. Created as a fief for the House of Bourbon-Parma as compensation for the
        Duchy of Parma being awarded to Napoleon’s wife Marie Louise of Austria as part of the
        post-Napoleonic settlement on the same boundaries of the Republic of Lucca. After Marie
        Louise passed in 1847 Duke Charles I reassumed his house’s traditional control of Parma;
        Lucca was annexed by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany.</notes>
