    <notes>In the 1850s, U.S., German, and British settlers on Samoa began lobbying their respective
        countries to annex Samoa. In 1899, the United States annexed Eastern Samoa, referred to as
        American Samoa. In the same year, Germany annexed Western Samoa, which it controlled until
        1914, at which time it fell under New Zealand’s control. In 1962, Western Samoa gained its
        independence and in 1997, dropped the ‘Western’ appellation, officially changing its name to
        Independent State of Samoa.</notes>
