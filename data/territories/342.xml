    <notes>From 1989 to 1992, Yugoslavia broke up into several newly separate states. Kosovo
        remained within the Federal Republic upon the final dissolution of the SFRY on April 28,
        1992. From September 22, 1992, to February 1, 1999, Kosovo was a self-declared independent
        republic which attempted to operate parallel national institutions from those in the Federal
        Republic of Yugoslavia. The Republic was never recognized as an independent state by the
        U.S. Government and eventually acceded to control by the Federal Republic. On February 4,
        2003, following constitutional reform, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia changed its name
        to the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.</notes>
