    <notes>In 1810, local juntas wrested control from Spanish authorities throughout the
        viceroyalty, including in Bogota on July 20, the day celebrated in Colombia as its
        independence day. While some areas within the viceroyalty remained loyal to Spain, others
        broke away. In 1811, Cundinamarca and the United Provinces of New Granada were established,
        formally declaring independence from Spain between 1811 and 1813; in 1814, Cundinamarca was
        integrated into the United Provinces of New Granada.</notes>
