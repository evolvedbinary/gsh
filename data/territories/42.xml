    <notes>In 1867, Canada was created as a self-governing dominion with domestic sovereignty out of
        three colonies, Canada, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick. While the country of Canada was
        established in 1867, its boundaries expanded over the next 8 decades as other British North
        American colonies and commercial possessions were incorporated into it: 1. In 1870, Rupert’s
        Land, a huge swath of territory owned by the Hudson’s Bay Company that had been purchased by
        the Canadian government, was incorporated into Canada. 2. In 1871, the colony of British
        Columbia joined Canada. 3. In 1873, the colony of Prince Edward Island joined Canada. 4. In
        1949, the dominion of Newfoundland (which was actually a quasi-colony at that point) joined
        Canada. While Canada traces its status as an independent nation back to 1867, technically
        the country acquired independence in stages. When it was created in 1867, Canada enjoyed
        only sovereignty over domestic affairs: it was still a part of the British Empire, meaning
        London directed its foreign policy. During the 1920s, Canada acquired sovereignty over its
        external affairs, culminating in the United Kingdom’s acceptance of Canada’s external
        sovereignty with the 1926 Balfour Declaration and the 1931 Statute of Westminster. In 1982,
        full independence was achieved when the United Kingdom passed the Canada Act, which gave
        effect to the Constitution Act, 1982, representing the patriation of Canada’s constitution.
        (Until that time, the Canadian constitution had been comprised of a series of laws passed by
        the British Parliament.) The United States recognized Canada's independence in 1927.</notes>
