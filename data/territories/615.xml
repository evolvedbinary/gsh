    <notes>The creation of the Free Territory of Trieste was motivated by the multi-ethnic character
        of the region (Italians and Balkan peoples); the harsh treatment of Balkans by the Mussolini
        government, which had attempted to Italianize the region by coercion; and the reality that
        the area was on a major dividing line in the new Cold War order between Western orientated
        Italy and communist Yugoslavia. United Nations Security Council Resolution 16 created the
        Free Territory and placed it under joint military administration. The Free Territory de
        facto ceased to exist on 5 October 1954 with the signing of the London Memorandum which
        transferred control of the two zones which comprised the territory to Italy and Yugoslavia
        respectively. The 1975 Treaty of Osimo between Italy and Yugoslavia was the last word on the
        subject, as each nation agreed to not contest the possession of the Trieste territories over
        which they currently exercised sovereignty.</notes>
