    <notes>Palau was part of the UN Trust Territory of the Pacific and under the administration of
        the United States following World War II until 1986, when Palau and the United States agreed
        to a Compact of Free Association with the United States (approved in 1986 but not ratified
        until 1993). Palau gained independence in 1994. Initially identified by the East India
        Company in 1783, Palau fell under both German and Spanish influence – through Catholic
        missionaries – throughout the 19th Century. Imperial Japan occupied Palau during World War
        II.</notes>
