    <notes>The Republic of Venice was a major economic and military power in the High Middle Ages;
        by the late 1700s it had declined considerably and was among the many states on the Apennine
        Peninsula captured by Napoleonâ€™s forces. On May 12, 1797, the last Doge abdicated and the
        republic was ended. Venice was granted to Austria as the Venetian province under the terms
        of the 1797 Treaty of Campo Formio. In 1805, after defeat at Austerlitz, Austria ceded the
        territory to France in the Treaty of Pressburg where it was integrated into the French
        client Kingdom of Italy. The Congress of Vienna awarded the territory of the former republic
        to Austria in 1815, see Lombardy Venetia for subsequent lineage.</notes>
