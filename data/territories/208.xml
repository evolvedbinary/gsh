    <notes>Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, the portions of the Ottoman empire that
        would ultimately become Saudi Arabia began to be contested. In 1824, Turki bin Abdullah bin
        Muhammed defeated Egyptian forces and regained control of Riyadh, establishing the Emirate
        of Nejd. In 1891, Muhammed ibn Abdallah bin Rashid of Haiâ€™l extended authority over most of
        Nejd including Riyadh. By 1902, Ibn Saud Abdulaziz regained control of Riyadh and created
        the Emirate of Nejd and Hasa (Emirate of Riyadh). An independent Kingdom of Hejaz was
        created on the western side of the Arabian Peninsula from the Turkish Vilayet of Hejaz. In
        1921, Abdulaziz created the Sultanate of Nejd in unifying the Emirate of Nejd and Hasa and
        the Emirate of Jabal Shammar and in 1926 created the Kingdom of Hejaz and Nejd that was
        renamed the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in 1932.</notes>
