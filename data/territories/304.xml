    <notes>Under a charter from Britain (granted in the wake of the 1885 Treaty of Berlin), the
        Royal Niger Company was granted a concession in 1886 to territory and trade in south-central
        Nigeria, in an area centered on Lukoja and the upper Niger River. The Royal Niger Company
        attempted to bring the Kingdom of Ilorin (a vassal state under the Fulani Empire) under
        British control in 1897, but was apparently unsuccessful in doing so. On January 1, 1900,
        the Royal Niger Companyâ€™s charter was terminated and its territorial claims turned over to
        the new Protectorates of Northern and Southern Nigeria, in return for the retention of
        certain mineral rights.</notes>
